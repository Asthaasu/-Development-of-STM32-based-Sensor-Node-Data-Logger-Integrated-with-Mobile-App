# ESP8266 + STM32 Temperature Logging & LED Control

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project integrates an **ESP8266** and an **STM32** to monitor temperature from a DS18B20 sensor, control an LED automatically or manually via **Blynk**, and log temperature data to **ThingSpeak**.

## ðŸ›  Features
- Real-time temperature monitoring with DS18B20
- Automatic LED control based on temperature threshold
- Manual LED control through Blynk mobile app
- Data logging to ThingSpeak for cloud monitoring

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
- `esp8266_code.ino` â†’ Handles WiFi, Blynk control, and ThingSpeak logging
- `stm32_code.ino` â†’ Reads temperature and controls LED
- `README.md` â†’ Project documentation

## ðŸš€ How It Works
1. **STM32** reads temperature and sends it to **ESP8266** over UART.
2. **ESP8266** uploads the data to **ThingSpeak** every 2 seconds.
3. **Blynk App** can send manual LED control commands to STM32.
4. LED automatically turns ON if temperature < 25Â°C (in auto mode).

## ðŸ”§ Hardware Required
- ESP8266 (NodeMCU)
- STM32 (Blue Pill)
- DS18B20 Temperature Sensor
- LED + Resistor
- Breadboard & Jumper Wires

## ðŸ“² Setup
1. Configure your **WiFi credentials** in `esp8266_code.ino`.
2. Update **ThingSpeak API Key** and **Blynk Auth Token**.
3. Upload respective codes to **ESP8266** and **STM32**.
4. Open **Blynk App** to control and monitor.
